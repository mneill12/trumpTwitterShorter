# trumpTwitterShorter
Server side spring boot app which will monitor Donald Trumps personal twitter account (@realDonaldTrump) for references to Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 companies. The stock prices of companies that are mentioned are then made available for consumption.

The end goal of this application is to track the stock movements of Companies that President Trump tweet about and see if a hypotetical short on the stocks of that company would be profitable. 

This is not an endorsement or condemnation of Trumps policys, views or actions but simply an odd idea that I had.
